# Wasteagram

This is a Flutter mobile app that enables users to document daily food waste in the form of "posts" consisting of a photo, a number of leftover items, the current date, and the location of the device when the post is created. Utilizes Google Firebase to store the posts and Google Analytics/Sentry to inspect the performance.
